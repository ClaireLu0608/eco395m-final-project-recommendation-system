I‚Äôve been looking for a full coverage foundation that has a natural & poreless finish and I finally found my holy grail. I do recommend prepping your skin and using a primer if you have oily skin like I do, my oils come through within an hour of application.

P427301,Natural Radiant Longwear Full Coverage Foundation Punjab - Medium 1,1,"This was beyond awful. I tried it because my usual product was out of stock and I didn't have time go to another location. The colour match was not even close, I trusted the process and the advice of the worker in store but when I got home it was comical how bad it was. Besides that, the consistency and blendability of this product is atrocious. It showed every imperfection on my skin and made my skin look awful.
