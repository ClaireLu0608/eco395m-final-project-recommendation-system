***User Interface:*** 
We design an interactive dashboard in Python using Streamlit for users to select with their preference and get the best fit product from our recommendation system. Make sure you uploaded your data to Google Cloud Platform with the instance beding started, and have your database credentials in the hided .env file. To open up the Streamlit dashboard, run the following command from the root and you are ready to go:
```bash
streamlit run code/recommendation_system/dashboard.py 
```
